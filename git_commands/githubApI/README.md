# Acquiring an API Key in GitHub

1. Log in to your GitHub account.

2. Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner and select "Settings" from the drop-down menu.

3. In the left sidebar, select "Developer settings".

4. Select "Personal access tokens" from the sub-menu.

5. Click on the "Generate token" button.

6. Enter a name for the token and select the appropriate scopes for the token. Scopes determine the level of access the token will have to your account.

7. Click on the "Generate token" button to create the token.

8. Save the token in a safe place, as it will not be shown again after this step.

9. You can now use the token to authenticate with the GitHub API or other tools that use GitHub for authentication.

Note: You can also use the same process to generate a token for an organization or to grant access to a specific repository or team.
